A free and asynchronous weather Python API wrapper made in Python, for Python.

## Getting started

Run the following command in your terminal:

```console
$ pip install python-weather
```

## Example

For more information, please read the [documentation](https://python-weather.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

```py
# Import the module.
import python_weather

import asyncio
import os


async def main() -> None:
  
  # Declare the client. The measuring unit used defaults to the metric system (celcius, km/h, etc.)
  async with python_weather.Client(unit=python_weather.IMPERIAL) as client:
    
    # Fetch a weather forecast from a city.
    weather = await client.get('New York')
    
    # Fetch the temperature for today.
    print(weather.temperature)
    
    # Fetch weather forecast for upcoming days.
    for daily in weather:
      print(daily)
    
      # Each daily forecast has their own hourly forecasts.
      for hourly in daily:
        print(f' --> {hourly!r}')

if __name__ == '__main__':
  
  # See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45600579/asyncio-event-loop-is-closed-when-getting-loop
  # for more details.
  if os.name == 'nt':
    asyncio.set_event_loop_policy(asyncio.WindowsSelectorEventLoopPolicy())
  
  asyncio.run(main())
```

## Data source

This library depends on [`wttr.in`](https://github.com/chubin/wttr.in), which uses data from the [World Weather Online API](https://www.worldweatheronline.com/weather-api/).
