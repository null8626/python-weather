A free and asynchronous weather Python API wrapper made in Python, for Python.

Getting started
---------------

Run the following command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

   pip install python-weather

Example
-------

.. code-block:: python

  # Import the module.
  import python_weather
  
  import asyncio
  
  
  async def main() -> None:

    # Declare the client. The measuring unit used defaults to the metric system (celcius, km/h, etc.)
    async with python_weather.Client(unit=python_weather.IMPERIAL) as client:
      
      # Fetch a weather forecast from a city.
      weather = await client.get('New York')
      
      # Fetch the temperature for today.
      print(weather.temperature)
      
      # Fetch weather forecast for upcoming days.
      for daily in weather:
        print(daily)
      
        # Each daily forecast has their own hourly forecasts.
        for hourly in daily:
          print(f' --> {hourly!r}')
  
  if __name__ == '__main__':
    asyncio.run(main())
